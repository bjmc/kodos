Kodos
-----

Kodos is a GUI tool for debugging Python Regular Expressions. It was originally [developed on SourceForge](http://kodos.sourceforge.net/) but appears to have been abandoned two or three years ago.

I'm hoping to update it and get it packaged for use on modern operating systems. Contributions welcome.

Additional HTML documentation is available in the `/help` folder.
